## Additional Context
Amtrak’s Records and Information Management (RIM) Program maintains a Records Retention Schedule, a crucial tool for tracking record-keeping policies. However, the current schedule exists as a 75-page PDF, making it difficult to search, update, and manage. This challenge seeks a better-designed, user-friendly solution that allows for easy input, navigation, and retrieval of retention policies. The ideal redesign should improve usability, accessibility, and efficiency, ensuring Amtrak employees can quickly find and apply record retention guidelines. By transforming this static document into an interactive, intuitive system, this project will modernize Amtrak’s records management process and enhance compliance.
