Please DO NOT modify any of the .php files, OTHER THAN index.php.  I got rid of index.html, as it did not offer
any sort of dynamic result display options.  You can modify index.php and styles.css; feel free to add
any necessary form pages to add records, submit any record requests, or guidelines on modifying CSV files.

Any of those NEW pages can be href'd within index.php and utilize HTML rather than PHP.  

Also I really cannot think of a simple way to add/remove/edit any of the CSVs in a LIVE session.  I added some
useless code to track user login sessions in the 13 department-specific PHP pages, I should probably edit those
out prior to our delivery.  The only way I can begin to even approach the add/remove/edit feature is with SQL,
and I really do not like working with SQL despite the fact that I am a peer mentor for a SQL class (INST327).
We will be omitting the add/remove/edit features for the time being, but FEEL FREE to keep the buttons on the
index.php page.  I added some functionality to "Submit Request" and "Guidelines."  "Record Portal" is a rename.
Perhaps the folks over at Amtrak can work their magic with SQL or some other live database.

Good morning when you see this!
